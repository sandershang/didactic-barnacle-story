Once upon a time, there lived a small boy, named Peanut, in a village far 
far away. Peanut was the prince in the village. 
His dad had passed away when he was an infant.
Peanut was the smallest boy and the weakest of the village.
No matter how much he ate, he didn't grow. While  walking in the market an
old man called him over. "would you help me carry these bags my son".
"he doesn't know who i am"- thaught peanut. "sure but I am not very strong"
The old man replied "they're not that heavy its just that the years
weren't kind to me, and now i am weakier than a small boy". peanut  felt hurt
by what the old man said, then remembered how being weak mad him feel
it must've been harder for someone how had strength than lost it.
"to where do you want me to carry them?", "just to the second floor. 
Prince peanut croutched to pick up the bags but couldn't lift them. "my 
god you're weaker than weak. this is just sad" shouted the old man.
Peanut got blinded by anger and tried to push the old man, but he push he 
only push himself off, fell backwards into a puddle. every one laughed at him.
